        <h1><a href="http://mfactor.sdf.org/too-many-tools-not-enough-carpenters-short-version.html">Too many tools, not enough carpenters (short version)</a></h1>
        <p>I came across a <a href="https://ckmadvisors.com/b/160212.html">great article</a> about tools in data science. The TL;DR of the article is, basically, tools will not solve your data problem, skills will. That's what the title is alluding: there are too many (some great, some mediocrer) tools, but not enough people skilled in really understanding the data and doing something useful or valuable with it. I will try to translate the article to a somewhat shorter version of the original, to make the point more accessible.</p>
<p>++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Big corporations are full with data but soon discover that transforming this data into something useful or valuable is very hard. On the other hand, startups are built from the ground up with data science ingrained on the very core, with a qualified team of data scientists, mainly because this data is the source of revenue.</p>
<p>Consumers don't pay for software a long time ago, so if you want to make money with software, you have to sell it to the enterprise. Data science is very hot right now, so software for data science is a no-brainer, right? Wrong. Big corporations are not like your startup: data is spread out in hundreds or thousands of systems that don't communicate. Huge amounts of data is generated and stored but until recently nobody thought about accessing or even less analysing this data. And as these corporations don't have data scientists in-house, nobody is really sure how this data can be used or even what this data <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Big companies also tried to do 'data warehousing', but usually these projects turn into an inconsistent and incomplete datasets, so even if a magic analysing software existed, there would be nowhere to be connected. </p>
<p>Many fail to understand that the core issue is not a lack of tools but a lack of carpenters.</p>
<p>These software companies bring their plug-and-play tools to only discover that they don't have a clue about the data environment inside a big corporation. Worse, they wouldn't know if their product solved a real defined business problem. They usually say, just dump all your data in our magic (very expensive, licensed locked) platform. What the tool was really capable of doing or adding value to the business was not relevant. </p>
<p>More specifically, the enterprise needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Plumbers</em> to make sure all the data flows to the right place where it can be integrated and harvested</li>
<li><em>Detectives/Designers</em> with strong data science skills to identify leads in the data and build those out into actionable opportunities for value generation</li>
<li><em>Data driven leaders</em> that can take these insights and elicit tangible change in large organizations</li>
<li><em>A data centric culture</em> which demands that business operations leverage all available factual information to drive efficiency and effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies early on the data science maturity curve are typically excited about tools. They buy a few 'new systems' that will produce amazing results but are sorely disappointed that these tools didn't deliver anything of value. Then finally the company moves to the next level, investing in organization and skills.</p>
<p>The truth is that a top team of data scientists can achieve great results using the toolsets already in place within a large enterprise, supplemented with some free (or very inexpensive) open source tools. Proprietary tools won't replace skilled talent, and skilled talent doesn't typically need many proprietary tools.</p>
<p>An organization that lacks such data science talent could spend many millions on data analytics tools and still not come anywhere close to the same results. When someone asks me to show them “the tool” that created these results, I introduce them to our data scientists. For the large enterprise, the challenge is finding and developing that talent base. </p>
<p>The market is gradually evolving into a more mature data science environment, away from the idea of extracting value of data is equal to buying more software licenses.</p>
<p>++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Hopefully these ideas can kickstart a healthy discussion about the place of tools and skill to be able to use the data that a company has to benefit all.</p>

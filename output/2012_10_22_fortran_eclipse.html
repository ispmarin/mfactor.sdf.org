    <p>Hey&nbsp;all,</p>
<p>I should have warned everyone: sometimes what seems to be the best is
not, and old habits die hard. Or, in a more direct way, after all the
fuss with Vim, I&#8217;m back to Eclipse. I know, I&nbsp;know&#8230;</p>
<p>Vim is great. Really, vim is great. But it&#8217;s just not what I need right
now. I programmed in vim in python and <span class="caps">FORTRAN</span>. I wrote makefiles again.
I even made a rep with vim rc scripts in github. But no dice. I&#8217;m a very
visual guy, and not being able to see what I was doing, where I was
going, was a dealbreaker. It seems that if I don&#8217;t have a clear picture
in my head on what&#8217;s going on, as I have with Linux systems in general
and as I don&#8217;t have when I&#8217;m writing new code, not being able to see
what files are part of the project, autocompletion out of the box, so on
and so forth, is not good. After I got all in my head, vim is very
productive, as I don&#8217;t have to reach for the mouse and I code all from
memory. But to prototype, to create new code, Eclipse so far is
superior. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but autocompletion is one
of the several examples. Just being able to press <span class="caps">CTRL</span> + Space and the
function definition is filled saves me a lot of time in two ways: first,
I don&#8217;t have to go to that piece of code to see what the interface is,
and second, as I keep my variable names consistent, sometimes just
putting the definition of the function is enough, not having to type
anything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>Vanilla Eclipse Juno <span class="caps">CDT</span>, Pydev, Photran, and Eclipse Colours, and
that&#8217;s it. Juno now supports git out of the box too. Other trick that is
saving me a lot of headaches is to keep several workspaces, one for each
kind of project. Right now I have pywork for Python code and lavalwork
for some code from&nbsp;Laval.</p>
<p>So here it is. I&#8217;m back, Eclipse! Just don&#8217;t throw me under the bus with
those ugly java exceptions&#8230;&nbsp;:-)</p>

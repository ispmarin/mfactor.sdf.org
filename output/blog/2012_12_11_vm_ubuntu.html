    <p>I tried. I swear I tried. But it&#8217;s plain and simple painful to develop
in Fortran in Windows. There, I said it. Is it <em>possible</em>? Yes. Is it
easy? Not a chance in&nbsp;Hell.</p>
<p>First of all, there aren&#8217;t a lot of options for Fortran Compilers for
the Microsoft Windows Platform (and I&#8217;m talking about Windows 7, I would
imagine that Windows 8 would be worse.). The most sane one, Intel
Fortran, is even now Intel Visual Fortran Compiler for Windows (<a class="reference external" href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-visual-fortran-compiler-for-windows">I kid
you
not</a>.).
And then there&#8217;s the interfaces. Microsoft provides for free the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products">Express</a>
suit, so things are not that bad, right? No. The Express suit can&#8217;t use
Intel Visual Fortran Compiler for Windows support, so you&#8217;re out of luck
unless you buy the full Visual Studio Suite, and which one I dunno -
never understood the Ultimate/Professional/Premium/Alien/KitchenCleaning
version confusion. Eclipse <span class="caps">CDT</span>/Photran would be a good one instead,
right? No. Intel Visual Fortran Compiler for Windows also doesn&#8217;t
support Eclipse <span class="caps">CDT</span>/Photran. Where to&nbsp;run?</p>
<p>Maybe MinGW could help us? Yes, maybe. Both Intel Visual Fortran
Compiler for Windows and MinGW can compile a Fortran source file from
the command line, but we&#8217;re in friggin Windows, right? Also, for large
projects, code completion and syntax errors are a must. I didn&#8217;t try the
<span class="caps">LLVM</span>/dragonegg and mingw-fortran combination, but as I wouldn&#8217;t get the
advantages that I&#8217;m looking for, I decided that if I have to use a
Windows machine, no one would prevent to use a sane, decent Linux
environment <em>inside</em> that Windows machine. Ubuntu plus VirtualBox it&nbsp;is!</p>
<p>Downloaded 12.10-amd64, installed in a <span class="caps">VDI</span> image, all with standard
options. Of course Ubuntu would give me some headaches: had to uninstall
that creepy shopping lens, install Google Chrome. Google Chrome
installation was interesting: the Software Center gave me an &#8220;This
package is of low quality. Don&#8217;t install it.&#8221; Just hit ignore and
install it anyway. And Ubuntu froze. Unity recomposed itself, but I
figured that there is something funky going on between X and VirtualBox,
so I went back to VirtualBox settings and disabled the 3D video, what
made things a bit better - but still no changing resolution with
changing the size of the <span class="caps">VM</span> window. Strange. Will probably install <span class="caps">KDE</span>
anyway&#8230; so I plugged my external drive to copy all the files to the
<span class="caps">VM</span>. And then, Compiz hanged again. Definitely annoying. So while I
waited to see what the 12.10 would do (keep freezed, it seems), decided
to use my <span class="caps">12GB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and my Core i7 and hit an 12.04 installation. It
started to be a little ironic that I was running away from one platform
that is impossible to program to another one that refuses to work to
begin with. I decided to keep going, nonetheless, and see where I would&nbsp;get.</p>
<p>I still kept my hopes that things would be easier after I got an Ubuntu
running. My plan was to use the <span class="caps">VM</span> as a full development environment
that I could transport easily to different computers. I thought about
keeping a git repository of the important stuff, but the multiplatform
problems that I detailed above with Fortran made this a no-go. 12.04 was
much better than 12.10, and while 12.10 was still frozen, I managed to
install 12.04, update it, install the required dkms modules for
VirtualBox. Also downloaded Eclipse <span class="caps">CDT</span>, <a class="reference external" href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/">Eclipse Colour
Plugin</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://pydev.org/">Pydev</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/photran/">Photran</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>, everything running ok! Copied
from my external drive all the source files, all beautiful. Decided not
to use 12.10 and stick with 12.04. So now, the next step: moving the <span class="caps">VM</span>
to the external&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p>After copying the entire <span class="caps">VB</span> folder to the external drive, I would have
to test it and see if there&#8217;s anything missing. And it works! Now doing
some backups on external hard drives and transporting happily my virtual
machines around. It&#8217;s cumbersome to transport <span class="caps">20GB</span> up and down an
external drive every time, but it&#8217;s better than use Windows to program,
that&#8217;s for&nbsp;sure!</p>
<p>One last trick: to share a folder between the Ubuntu guest and Windows
host and be able to create soft symlinks, I had to issue this command in
the Windows&nbsp;host:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
VBoxManage setextradata VM_NAME VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/SHARE_NAME 1


Where VM_NAME is your virtual machine name. Done!

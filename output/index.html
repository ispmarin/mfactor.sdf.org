      <p>A long time ago, on a land of big iron and MPI, there were some
libraries that were used everywhere. The libraries were fundamental to
most of the important computation that was done, they were open source
and all the cool kids on the block knew them. They also rarely were
distributed by the Linux distributions, and several versions needed to
coexist to support all the high performance software that needed to be
run. They needed to be compiled, and different versions of compilers and
libraries and binaries kept spiralling out of control. Keeping them
working was already a huge task, and working well was even harder. And
yes, I'm talking about BLAS and LAPACK.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a> (Basic Linear Algebra Suprograms)
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> (Linear Algebra PACKAge),
from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.netlib.org/">Netlib</a>, were fundamental on the HPC
era as the backbone of inumerous projects. The stack on those days had
one flavour or another of
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI</a> to run
the parallel jobs in huge clusters, together with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/">ScaLAPACK</a>. And the job of keeping
these libraries working with several different compilers (mainly
<a class="reference external" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers">Intel</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pgroup.com/">Portland Group</a> compilers ) and linking
binaries objects were the nightmare of any sysadmin. Written mainly in
Fortran, with wrappers for C and C++, a sysadmin had to keep the entire
stack compiled with the right version of compilers and linked with the
right libraries. Projects like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.netlib.org/atlas/">ATLAS</a>
tried to help a bit on the side of performance optimization, while
vendors had their own binary distribution, tuned to their processors
(<a class="reference external" href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl">MKL</a> for Intel and
<a class="reference external" href="http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/cpu-development/amd-core-math-library-acml/">ACML</a>
for AMD).</p>
<p>A sysadmin on the HPC world had to know all these libraries, how to
deploy them to the users that wanted to compile their own programs, and
how to make all of them play nice with each other on the same cluster.
It was hard to keep track of what was breaking, with lots of non
standard paths and binary objects, name mangling, and users trying to do
things that you never imagined possible. The HPC sysadmin also needed to
know the underlying architecture very well, including the network and
storage structures, the physical layout of the cables, so he or she
could have a chance to know what was breaking or lagging.&nbsp; Slowly, these
tools started to be better organized, with practices like module loading
and the linux distributions creating packages to the basic libraries,
even if the performance was not the best possible. And then the Cloud
happened.</p>
<p>(I'm not going to dwelve on the HPC vs Cloud debate, not even try to
touch the Big Data vs BI vs computing debates, and try to focus on the
tools that make all these acronyms possible, otherwise this would be a
very long post.)</p>
<p>I have some time now on my hands and decided to check how the deployment
and configuration of a Spark cluster is being done on
<a class="reference external" href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/">Debian</a>. And boy, <a class="reference external" href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html">what a
surprise</a>.
I've been seeing several posts from sysadmins complaining about the
dockerization of applications and the mirage of the devops, but was
taken aback with the state of how Spark is suposed to be deployed on a
Debian (<a class="reference external" href="http://bigtop.apache.org/book/apache-bigtop-user-guide/apache-bigtop-user-guide.html">or any other
linux</a>)
installation. There are several binaries spread out, with
interdependencies, depending on the compiler version or library version,
without standard paths, and users making a even larger mess... where did
I hear about it before?</p>
<p>I expected that with the amout of resources that are being poured on the
cloud projects, some form of organization or standardization would have
happened. But no luck: all is still downloading binaries and compiling
tons of disconnected but interdependent libraries, only with more levels
of abstraction. Yes, the abstraction levels help the user, as he doesn't
need anymore to know about if the processor has SSE3 or SSE4.2. Yes, now
devops can be both programmers and sysadmins. Yes, you don't have to buy
new machines, install them, plug the cables - you can just go to the AWS
console and click moar instances. But someone, on the end, has to move
all this to production, keep it working, plan on how this will grow, and
fix it when it breaks - and it will break, trust me.</p>
<p>Oh, but there's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>to the
rescue! Well, not really. I'm also not going to go deep into OpenStack,
but suffice to say that OpenStack is more an orchestration service than
what I'm looking into here.</p>
<p>And oh, there's Docker/Vagrant/CoreOS/etc containers! Well, that's also
an issue that I think is not the focus of this discussion. During the
HPC era, usually the application deployment consisted of: configuring
the computing nodes to communicate, share the data using a dedicated
network connected to a RAID server and running a binary on a NFS share.
Things got way more complicated because they are more complicated:
connection to several databases, web services, what not. But in the end
the problem is the same: how to deploy an environment that you can
maintain and fix? These technologies help immensely on empowering the
developer to create more complex solutions and abstract more, especially
parallel computations, but they actually make the maitain and fix part
way more complicated, from the sysadmin perspective. That's why I'm not
trying to address again these tools: they solve another problem, and
anyway, you have to configure these containers with the same binaries
and libraries, that need to be compiled, going back to the initial
problem!</p>
<p>So, is there a way to solve this mess? Unfortunately, I don't know. I've
been sidelining all these issues on the day to day at work, adding
binaries and virtualenvs when needed, but this will explode soon or
later. I just think that this problem is not being looked with much
care, especially on the startup world, or just being pushed to the new
<a class="reference external" href="https://anotherlifeform.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/7d267-11359006_420191058182770_2015412754_n.jpg">shiny new
thing</a>that
will solve everything with more abstraction. What to do? Maybe to think
about these points when deploying your cluster, playing better with the
basic distributions and contributing more, and the distros trying not to
suffer from NIH syndrome would help.</p>
<p>I'm all ears for suggestions!</p>

      <p>I´ve been overwhelmed by the number of good publications, workbooks and
other material on Python and Data Science on the web. I tried to keep
track and read everything, but my time on the job has been limited for
that. I decided to keep a list of the sources that I´m reading or want

Survival analysis in R and Python. Excellent resource to combine
ipython notebooks with R. (The entire plotly notebooks collection is
awesome. I would love if plotly was open source or at least free.)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks">https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks</a> This is
an awesome collection of notebooks with all the parts of a good data

  <div>
      <p>It's 2015 and it's the first time that I'm using Python 3
professionally. And I have to admit, if I knew that all my scripts were
going to work so easily with 3, I would have changed way before. There
were a few hurdles with the Python 3 version of some libraries - patsy,
I'm looking at you - but so far the transition was painless. The things
that I had to change were expected, like the print function and some
dict operations, and xrange. I know it's for the best now, so let's
roll.</p>
<p>First of all, I switched from WinPython to Anaconda. Having to work on a
constrained Windows installation, Anaconda provides better support for
installing packages than pip alone. And as so far using virtualenv has
not been a success on Windows, I'm going to try the conda environment
for my projects.</p>
<p>On the version control front, I finally got access to a git shell on
Windows, and now I can keep my sanity working with code. There's even a
Team Foundation Server plugin for it, and the client is not that bad -
actually, it's useful and keeps the git terminology, helping immensely
someone that was used to git on the command line. Not bad, Microsoft.
Git-cola is still better and is several times smaller than TFS, but hey,
sometimes we have to use what we got. So my working environment now is</p>
<p>* Anaconda 2.2.0, Python 3 version</p>
<p>* Packages:</p>
<p>-pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, calendar, sqlalchemy with Oracle plugin,
seaborn (mostly for styles), statsmodels.</p>
<p>* Editor:</p>
<p>Vim and ipython notebook (depending on the type of work)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://msysgit.github.io/">Git for Windows</a></p>
<p>and Tableau for some visualizations.</p>

      <p>As a data scientist, I have to deal with data from several different
sources. This begs for a wide range of tools and great flexibility of
using these tools, otherwise manipulating the data can be almost
impossible. And then your employer says that you can only use Windows,
without admin rights, and you can only install software from a very
restrict pre-approved list. What do you do? Go to a corner and cry?</p>
<p>Almost. But then, you find a breach, a sliver of hope. You can install
python on your machine. And in this moment, you smile, asking if you're
up to the challenge. (Dramatic, no?)</p>
<p>With one of the best Python installations for Windows is
<a class="reference external" href="https://winpython.github.io/">WinPython</a>, that comes prepackaged
with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/winpython/winpython/issues/56">Numpy, Scipy and
Pandas</a> and other
neat stuff, you can start really working. The second best part is that
you can install on your user folder, so you don't need admin rights.
Ufta! And the savior for sane workflows in this setting is
<a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, the new IPython shell. It is awesome
for the data and modelling workflow.</p>
<p>My workflow now consists of:</p>
<p>1. Getting all raw data in one place, be excel spreadsheets (don't ask),
CSV files, word files (I said don't ask!), and some data banks. Most of
my data are time series.</p>
<p>2. Importing the data or connecting the services on a jupyter python
notebook. I have to connect to an oracle BD, so
<a class="reference external" href="http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/">cx_Oracle</a> is the connector.</p>
<p>3. Parsing the data with
<a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.io.excel.ExcelFile.parse.html">ExcelFile</a>
from <a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>. It can be tricky. As each
sheet is different, I use a JSON file with the starting line, starting
and ending columns, number of lines to be read and headers. That way I
can process it automatically, and if the file changes is quite easy to
adjust.</p>
<p>4. Ok, clear the data! This is usually the most problematic part. One of
the things that I had to do was to convert zero values to NaNs. The
reason is that zero is a valid value on my data, but not a real one, so
it would skew all statistics. Pandas can handle NaNs in the<a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.16.0/gotchas.html">Right
Way</a>,
so you would be better off. But beware, there are a few problems with
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29747850/error-using-bootstrap-plot-in-pandas-if-values-have-nan">some
functions</a>,
so you have to be careful anyway.</p>
<p>5. With the data in a proper format, (<a class="reference external" href="www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper">tidy
format</a>, NaNs for invalid values,
all values with proper references), I start doing some exploratory
analysis on the data. For now, basic stuff like line graphs, boxplots,
averages by year and month, autocorrelation and some rolling means, and
scatter plots.</p>
<p>6. With that things start to get more interesting. I decided to use
<a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a> to do the regressions
instead of statsmodels because of the next step, prediction. You have to
transform the data again so scikit can understand it, but it's<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29748717/use-scikit-learn-to-do-linear-regression-on-a-time-series-pandas-data-frame">not
that
hard</a>,
and worth the while. Now I do some stardard Linear Squares to get the
trend and a RANSAC to get more specific results.</p>
<p>And all this inside a ipython notebook! Pretty awesome, right? Next
steps, do a full
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Jenkins">Box-Jenkins</a> on
the results.</p>

      <p>Yes, the title is a flamebait, but please bear with me.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="https://dxprience.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/bear-with-me.jpg" /></p>
<p>As I said in the last post, I installed Debian on my Chromebook using
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">crouton</a>. It worked quite
easily, KDE installed. But then I started building my dev environment,
using Python. But first, a quick digression.</p>
<p>I have to use Windows at work now. I know, I know, but there's no way
around it. Setting up a dev environment on Windows is very very tricky
and not very funny, especially if you don't have admin rights on your
own machine. I managed to get the basics working, but it was not easy.
The loop search internet-&gt;download-&gt;install-&gt;internet was not fun at all
after all these years with apt-get.</p>
<p>So, when I started setting up my environment on the Debian on the
chromebook it struck me. <em>I'm doing exactly as I done in Windows.</em> How
so? First, I installed Python 2.7.9 via apt-get. Nothing funny so far.
Then I decided to use a virtualenv. Ops. To install it I can use the
Debian package or download a newer version directly. Ok, ok... but then
it comes virtualenvwrapper. Ok, I still can install it using the Debian
repos, but it's an old version. After I set up my virtualenv, I start
using pip. Pip is ok, but now I have to download all packages from
different places. I know that this is one of the features of pip, but
nonetheless is divorced from the operating system, there is no search to
speak about inside pip, there is no update all, etc etc. Ok, but there
is still hope, right? Next thing, PyCharm. Bam, gotta go back to the
internet, download it, install... Windows again!</p>
<p>You can argue that I chose to use these packages, that there are several
in the Debian repos that can satisfy my needs. That this is just a rant
that &quot;package A or B is not in the repos!&quot;, and I tend to agree with
you. But I didn't have to do nothing like this when I was developing in
C, C++ or Fortran, including libraries, so I started thinking that maybe
the Python tools integration with Debian or any other Linux distro is
not as good as it could be. What can we do to make it easier? So far I
don't know. Any suggestions?</p>

      <p>I tried. I swear I tried. But it's plain and simple painful to develop
in Fortran in Windows. There, I said it. Is it <em>possible</em>? Yes. Is it
easy? Not a chance in Hell.</p>
<p>First of all, there aren't a lot of options for Fortran Compilers for
the Microsoft Windows Platform (and I'm talking about Windows 7, I would
imagine that Windows 8 would be worse.). The most sane one, Intel
Fortran, is even now Intel Visual Fortran Compiler for Windows (<a class="reference external" href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-visual-fortran-compiler-for-windows">I kid
you
not</a>.).
And then there's the interfaces. Microsoft provides for free the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products">Express</a>
suit, so things are not that bad, right? No. The Express suit can't use
Intel Visual Fortran Compiler for Windows support, so you're out of luck
unless you buy the full Visual Studio Suite, and which one I dunno -
never understood the Ultimate/Professional/Premium/Alien/KitchenCleaning
version confusion. Eclipse CDT/Photran would be a good one instead,
right? No. Intel Visual Fortran Compiler for Windows also doesn't
support Eclipse CDT/Photran. Where to run?</p>
<p>Maybe MinGW could help us? Yes, maybe. Both Intel Visual Fortran
Compiler for Windows and MinGW can compile a Fortran source file from
the command line, but we're in friggin Windows, right? Also, for large
projects, code completion and syntax errors are a must. I didn't try the
LLVM/dragonegg and mingw-fortran combination, but as I wouldn't get the
advantages that I'm looking for, I decided that if I have to use a
Windows machine, no one would prevent to use a sane, decent Linux
environment <em>inside</em> that Windows machine. Ubuntu plus VirtualBox it is!</p>
<p>Downloaded 12.10-amd64, installed in a VDI image, all with standard
options. Of course Ubuntu would give me some headaches: had to uninstall
that creepy shopping lens, install Google Chrome. Google Chrome
installation was interesting: the Software Center gave me an &quot;This
package is of low quality. Don't install it.&quot; Just hit ignore and
install it anyway. And Ubuntu froze. Unity recomposed itself, but I
figured that there is something funky going on between X and VirtualBox,
so I went back to VirtualBox settings and disabled the 3D video, what
made things a bit better - but still no changing resolution with
changing the size of the VM window. Strange. Will probably install KDE
anyway... so I plugged my external drive to copy all the files to the
VM. And then, Compiz hanged again. Definitely annoying. So while I
waited to see what the 12.10 would do (keep freezed, it seems), decided
to use my 12GB of RAM and my Core i7 and hit an 12.04 installation. It
started to be a little ironic that I was running away from one platform
that is impossible to program to another one that refuses to work to
begin with. I decided to keep going, nonetheless, and see where I would
get.</p>
<p>I still kept my hopes that things would be easier after I got an Ubuntu
running. My plan was to use the VM as a full development environment
that I could transport easily to different computers. I thought about
keeping a git repository of the important stuff, but the multiplatform
problems that I detailed above with Fortran made this a no-go. 12.04 was
much better than 12.10, and while 12.10 was still frozen, I managed to
install 12.04, update it, install the required dkms modules for
VirtualBox. Also downloaded Eclipse CDT, <a class="reference external" href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/">Eclipse Colour
Plugin</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://pydev.org/">Pydev</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/photran/">Photran</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>, everything running ok! Copied
from my external drive all the source files, all beautiful. Decided not
to use 12.10 and stick with 12.04. So now, the next step: moving the VM
to the external drive.</p>
<p>After copying the entire VB folder to the external drive, I would have
to test it and see if there's anything missing. And it works! Now doing
some backups on external hard drives and transporting happily my virtual
machines around. It's cumbersome to transport 20GB up and down an
external drive every time, but it's better than use Windows to program,
that's for sure!</p>
<p>One last trick: to share a folder between the Ubuntu guest and Windows
host and be able to create soft symlinks, I had to issue this command in
the Windows host:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
VBoxManage setextradata VM_NAME VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/SHARE_NAME 1


Where VM_NAME is your virtual machine name. Done!

The last post (in Portuguese) said that I was switching Debian. It's
true! Me, a debianist for the past 10 years, decided to switch Debian to
another distribution. The problem is, Debian is too hard to let go.
After a quite well
manneredÂ \ `discussion <http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2pyvvr/serious_changing_distros_goodbye_debian_hello/>`__
in Reddit, I decided to try OpenSuse Tumbleweed. It sounded exactly what
I was looking for: a rolling distribution with top notch KDE integration
and no yum.

But, after trying for a while to make it work with a pendrive (it didn't
boot from it) and freezing on the installation process (wat) I ran out
of time and switch back to Debian. Well, I didn't even unistall it, just
rebooted. Debian is still annoying me with its heavy political
discussion on the mailing lists and old version packages (more on that
in the next post) but it just works. It works so well that I just
installed it on my Samsung Chromebook along side ChromeOS. And it runs
really well.

Just came across\ `this blog
post <https://nylas.com/blog/packaging-deploying-python>`__ about how to
deploy python code on production servers. It makes a lot of sense. Gonna
try it and check if is really that simple. The
`hackernews <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9861127>`__\ discussion
is also worthwhile, although it seems that there are several docker
defenders there.

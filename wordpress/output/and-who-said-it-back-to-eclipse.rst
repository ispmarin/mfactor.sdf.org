Hey all,

I should have warned everyone: sometimes what seems to be the best is
not, and old habits die hard. Or, in a more direct way, after all the
fuss with Vim, I'm back to Eclipse. I know, I know...

Vim is great. Really, vim is great. But it's just not what I need right
now. I programmed in vim in python and FORTRAN. I wrote makefiles again.
I even made a rep with vim rc scripts in github. But no dice. I'm a very
visual guy, and not being able to see what I was doing, where I was
going, was a dealbreaker. It seems that if I don't have a clear picture
in my head on what's going on, as I have with Linux systems in general
and as I don't have when I'm writing new code, not being able to see
what files are part of the project, autocompletion out of the box, so on
and so forth, is not good. After I got all in my head, vim is very
productive, as I don't have to reach for the mouse and I code all from
memory. But to prototype, to create new code, Eclipse so far is
superior. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but autocompletion is one
of the several examples. Just being able to press CTRL + Space and the
function definition is filled saves me a lot of time in two ways: first,
I don't have to go to that piece of code to see what the interface is,
and second, as I keep my variable names consistent, sometimes just
putting the definition of the function is enough, not having to type
anything else.

Vanilla Eclipse Juno CDT, Pydev, Photran, and Eclipse Colours, and
that's it. Juno now supports git out of the box too. Other trick that is
saving me a lot of headaches is to keep several workspaces, one for each
kind of project. Right now I have pywork for Python code and lavalwork
for some code from Laval.

So here it is. I'm back, Eclipse! Just don't throw me under the bus with
those ugly java exceptions... :-)

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a Physicist turned computer scientist turned engineer turned data scientist 
(turned to something amorphous and purple, probably). 
Working with science, Python and data, I&amp;#8217;m trying to understand this thing 
called reality that everyone keeps talking&amp;nbsp;about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work as a Data Science Specialist at Telefônica Brasil, 
working with machine learning and data analysis of huge datasets. 
I&amp;#8217;m a physicist with masters in Solid State Physics and a 
PhD on Hydraulic Engineering, being also a photography enthusiast and a science fiction&amp;nbsp;fan.&lt;/p&gt;

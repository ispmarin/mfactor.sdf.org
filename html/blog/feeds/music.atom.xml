</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a orphan from Grooveshark, used to listen to it non-stop. All kinds of music were there.
As it wasn&amp;#8217;t strictly legal, it got closed, of course. During this time, I amassed a large
number of tracks that I enjoyed, even made some&amp;nbsp;playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saved these playlists on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; files a long time ago. Cleaning up some old stuff,
I came across these files and decided that they should become some Spotify playlists.
But&amp;nbsp;how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several scripts that convert CSVs with Artist and Song name to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XPLS&lt;/span&gt; format,
but to transfer to Spotify, all scripts would need some form of access to my account.
As I was not willing to provide my credentials, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally found the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.playlist-converter.net/#/"&gt;Playlist Converter&lt;/a&gt;, that
transforms the playlist into Spotify track codes, without needing my credentials.
Awesome! After uploading the CSVs, the site would convert to Spotify track codes.
I then created an empty playlist on Spotify, copied and pasted the track codes
on the Spotify client, and voilá, all songs were&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

other material on Python and Data Science on the web. I tried to keep
track and read everything, but my time on the job has been limited for
that. I decided to keep a list of the sources that I´m reading or want
to read here. They are, in no&amp;nbsp;order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fullstackpython.com/"&gt;http://www.fullstackpython.com/&lt;/a&gt; Awesome resource for Python web&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/survival-analysis-r-vs-python/"&gt;https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/survival-analysis-r-vs-python/&lt;/a&gt;
Survival analysis in R and Python. Excellent resource to combine
ipython notebooks with R. (The entire plotly notebooks collection is
awesome. I would love if plotly was open source or at least&amp;nbsp;free.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks"&gt;https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks&lt;/a&gt; This is
an awesome collection of notebooks with all the parts of a good data
stack on Python. Still no time to review them all, but so far, very
good and detailed. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/effect_size.ipynb"&gt;This is
one&lt;/a&gt;
of the best on the statistical&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/"&gt;http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/&lt;/a&gt; This one is very through, even
if sometimes a bit rough on the edges. Very good reference material.
There are other materials from the folks at Duke that are very good,
like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/pcfb/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; one, a bit more&amp;nbsp;biological.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning"&gt;https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning&lt;/a&gt; More on the
line of Machine Learning, this collection is also quite good, if a
bit extensive. The objective is more to list all resources and
libraries on several languages about Machine Learning than just
Python, but nonetheless the Python section is&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping the more generalist vibe,&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wzchen.com/data-science-books"&gt;this
list&lt;/a&gt;of free books
about Data Science has the basic stuff for the&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep things updated here as the list grows. Please send me
suggestions of good resources that you want to see on this&amp;nbsp;list!&lt;/p&gt;

    <p>After a long struggle of finding a new laptop and deciding to let my
trusted <span class="caps">XPS</span> 15 go, finally I got a Lenovo Ideapad Y500, an awesome
configuration for the price. So this is going to be my journal of the
process of getting this machine to&nbsp;work!</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 12:35:00 The note arrives. The lenovo people didn&#8217;t put the
number of my apartment on my order, so I had to lurk and wait the <span class="caps">UPS</span>
girl on my door. Good thing I have good ears! She was very nice, and
more importantly, she asked for a piece of <span class="caps">ID</span> before handling the&nbsp;notebook.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 12:40:00 Unpacked! The packaging is very spartan, only the
most basic stuff came. Quite nice, though, no&nbsp;frills.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 12:42:00 Turned it on, checked it, did the entire Windows 8
login process. The screen is marvelous, quite impressed with the&nbsp;quality.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 12:43:00 And removed all partitions that came with the note,
including the recovery and the other stuff! Gone! Gone now! Bye bye
Windows 8! Hello Windows 7! I had to disable Secure Boot and <span class="caps">UEFI</span>, set
the boot mode to legacy and legacy first devices, removed _all_
partitions, and plug a Windows 7 installation from a <span class="caps">USB</span> key. The boot
menu button is on the left side, just next to the power plug. Shutdown
the note and press the button. Booted, ran,&nbsp;ok.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 12:48:00 Finished the installation, here it comes the first
boot. Decided to use <span class="caps">250GB</span> for windows, gonna use around 60 for Debian,
and the rest is going to be /home. The only reason why the windows
partition is that big is because of the games. C&#8217;mon, it has a friggin
Nvidia 750M on&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 13:00:00 The Windows 7 installation finished, but of course
there are no drivers. I&#8217;m downloading the drivers from the lenovo
website to an external drive to be able to install&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 13:25:00 After installing all drivers, one by one, I
realized that Nvidia stable driver can&#8217;t handle the <span class="caps">GT</span> 750M, so I had to
go back to the lenovo site to get the driver from them, and realize that
is just the beta driver from Nvidia&#8230; Rebooted (3 times now), and <span class="caps">OMFG</span>
the screen is nice. Fuck, it is nice. Still tons of stuff to install in
Windows, but now is time to install Debian! Copied the netinst image
(using dd, dd if=&lt;image&gt; of=/dev/sdc bs=4m; sync) from debian netinst,
clicked the button on the side, plugged, and it booted. Installing&nbsp;now!</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 13:33:00 Hit my first snag with Debian. It asked the
firmware for the wireless card, so I had to go to
<a class="reference external" href="http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi/?n=downloads#Firmware">here</a>
and copied to the external drive. It didn&#8217;t find the firmware, even if
it was in the folder. Had to copy the .tgz to make it work, not only the
ucode. Trying to read it&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 13:43:00 It didn&#8217;t work, so I had to proceed with the
installation without the firmware for the wifi. Gonna have to copy the
.deb later. And now this is tempting: The debian installer is allowing
me to install it on the internal <span class="caps">SSD</span>! But when I tried, it failed. It
also failed to see the <span class="caps">GPT</span> Windows partitions, so I had to hit the webs
to find how to do it. Had to go to the &#8220;expert install&#8221;. The expert
install also allowed me to choose the <span class="caps">NTFS</span> partition handler, so maybe
that was the problem with the external harddrive. I&#8217;m already
downloading an Ubuntu 13.04&nbsp;image&#8230;</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 14:05:00 And Debian refuses to see the <span class="caps">GPT</span> partition table.
Gonna have to reset everything, reinstall windows with a <span class="caps">MBR</span> partition,
and then reinstall the rest.&nbsp;Damn.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 14:47:00 Had lunch - not really important, but good to know
that I didn&#8217;t take that amout of time :-) So now reinstalling windows.
This time I&#8217;ll try to install Debian before installing everything in&nbsp;windows.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 15:08:00 Finally! Debian found all partitions and now is
hapilly installing. No luck with the wifi, though, gonna have to do it
after installing the&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 15:26:00 After finishing the Debian installation <span class="caps">GRUB</span> only
booted windows. I said a big no to Debian and went Ubuntu. Not because I
can&#8217;t install Debian, but because I don&#8217;t have the time. Ubuntu booted
and already connected to my wireless network. And it failed to write to
the hard disk. Linux on this machine is getting more and more
frustrating to install. Downloading a new Ubuntu image and checking the
<span class="caps">MD5</span>, just to be&nbsp;sure.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 16:10:00 Image checksummed, copied and booted. Ubuntu
installation is almost finished, still&nbsp;running.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 16:30:00 Ubuntu installation finished! There is now a
problem with the Windows install. The Windows install put it on the <span class="caps">SSD</span>,
and I only got grub working after removing the Windows partition from
the <span class="caps">SSD</span>. Ubuntu boots, but windows dont&#8230; So here we go again get a
Windows live usb to boot and fix the mbr _one more time_. If I knew
that before I could have kept Debian. But, alas&#8230; Installing <span class="caps">KDE</span>&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 18:00:00 <span class="caps">KDE</span> installed, Ubuntu system ready to rock. But for
some reason the Windows partittion, although is intact, can&#8217;t be found
to boot, and can&#8217;t boot windows from the <span class="caps">USB</span> key. Finishing burning an
old fashioned <span class="caps">DVD</span> with the Windows 7 image and will try to recover. If
it works, great; if it doesn&#8217;t, so sorry, gonna move to the new computer
and Windows will be installed&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 18:09:00 Windows booted from the <span class="caps">DVD</span>, gonna try to fix it
from the recovery menu. Ran &nbsp;the automatic repair, and it fixed the
windows&nbsp;installation.</p>
<p>2013-05-14, 18:30:00 Booted on Ubuntu again, after Windows was running,
did the usual installations steps for repairing grub, e voilá! Both
systems are ok! But it should be noted that I had to do a grub-install
/dev/sda, the mSATA, <span class="caps">NOT</span> the sda disk. What a&nbsp;mess!</p>
<p>Now is copying all files to the new note&nbsp;:-)</p>

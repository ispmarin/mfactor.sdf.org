    <p>I finally got my hands on a decent monitor, the <a class="reference external" href="http://accessories.la.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=br&amp;l=pt&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=brdhs1&amp;sku=480-ACXS">Dell
<span class="caps">U2515H</span></a>.
It has been, so far, an awesome monitor. But that showed a few issues
with my standard Debian installation, with <span class="caps">KDE</span> 4.14 on Debian Unstable.
It seemed that every <span class="caps">GTK</span> application decided to throw a fit together and
nothing worked. I tried to adjust a lot of stuff on gtk-qt to fix it to
no avail but as it was <span class="caps">GTK</span> that was giving me headaches, maybe
installing Gnome things would be better on <span class="caps">KDE</span> side. So after a really
long time I decided to test a new window manager while at it, and now
I&#8217;m running Gnome 3.16 on Debian Unstable. (Also, it is a good change of
pace while I wait for <span class="caps">KDE</span> 5 hit&nbsp;Unstable.)</p>
<p>But, as every transition&#8230; things got a little rough. The <a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/UkoAaLDpF4i">famous
rant</a> by
Linus Torvalds rings very true: they simplified so much that it&#8217;s dumb
(even if Linus is <a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/115250422803614415116/posts/KygiWsQc4Wm">using it
again</a>).
There are some things that I found to be incredible as design decisions,
and Gnome Extensions is one of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>C&#8217;mon, how am I supposed to keep different systems updated, with the
same extensions? How do I know that they will work before I install
them? Who makes them? There are a few packaged in Debian, but not
enough. And to see how this is crazy, I had to install extensions to
show a suspend button, wicd-gtk on a tray, and I still can&#8217;t find one to
easily lock my screen or close the session! So both things that
shouldn&#8217;t be broken, standard desktop stuff and extensions, are broken
in one&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Also, there is no easy way to change the system fonts, colors or
everything else. I had to use gnome-tweak-tool to do all this, a
non-standard tool, and still there are a ton of stuff that I should be
able to configure and it is removed. Even in more lighter environments,
like <span class="caps">LXDE</span>, I stil can change the icons or set a random image as my
wallpaper, as a user. I don&#8217;t want to copy stuff to /usr or other system
directories, I should be able to override the system paths with folders
on my home directory, preferably under .local or .config. (And if you&#8217;re
thinking that I must go to the image, right-click it to set as wallpaper
as the only way to do it, no, that is no proper behavior.) The fact that
even if I do the right-click thing, now I have a folder called
Wallpapers on my home folder buggers me. I didn&#8217;t ask for a wallpaper
folder, just use any path that I gave you! <span class="caps">ME</span>, not Gnome programmers,
know were my files should&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Also, I can&#8217;t lock my screen if <span class="caps">GDM</span> is not running. This is now really
bad, not just annoyances like before. They hand-wave this away saying
that this will be solved with Wayland, but Wayland has been in
development for a while and it&#8217;s not shipping as production ready for
another not known time, so I would have to wait for it to lock my
screen? I don&#8217;t want to run <span class="caps">GDM</span>, I should be able to run whatever login
manager I want and be able to lock my screen in the <span class="caps">WM</span>. If Gnome keeps
following this &#8220;Windows&#8221; path all the complaints in the last years would
be true. The dependency on their own backyard instead of keeping things
interchangeable is a very troubling sign, and like the systemd debacle,
it just keeps getting&nbsp;worse.</p>
<p>I understand the need for standards, and <span class="caps">XDG</span> directives are ok, but
instead of thinking that the users are dumb, please at least let us
choose. I know this is kinda of a old rant against Gnome, and it can get
very ugly if I start mentioning Gnome 2, but from a fresh start, Gnome
right now is bad. Yadda yadda use another window manager, I get it. I
will, as soon I can get my hands on <span class="caps">KDE</span> 5. But for now, maybe another
voice trying to show what is broken, from an outside perspective, can
help a bit into steering things on a better&nbsp;path.</p>

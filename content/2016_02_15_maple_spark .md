Summary: Doing scientific computing and business projects, from Maple to Spark

All started with cleaning up my bin folder.

Describe the idea of first using Maple in Physics, then doing our own 
computer programs and simulations, the time it took to write them and 
the support that we had for it, to today environment of using more "basic" 
programming languages and environments, less complete, but more efficient.

Why Matlab and Mathematica are not used in business organizations, 
as they are supposedly more feature complete and simple to use?

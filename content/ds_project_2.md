Summary: Jupyter notebook for data analysis using the project structure

As a follow up of the [previous post]({filename}ds_project.md), here I present a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook that incorporates a few
things that makes easier to follow the ideias of the data project structure. 

The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/ispmarin/ds_workshop/blob/master/src/template_ds_workshop.ipynb). 
Using the idea of auto documentation of the notebooks, this notebook details the ideas.

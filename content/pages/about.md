Hi there!

I'm a Physicist turned computer scientist turned engineer turned data scientist (turned to something amorphous and purple, probably). Working with science, Python and data, I'm trying to understand this thing called reality that everyone keeps talking about. 

I work as a Data Science Specialist at Telef√¥nica Brasil, working with machine learning and data analysis of huge datasets. I'm a physicist with masters in Solid State Physics and a PhD on Hydraulic Engineering, being also a photography enthusiast and a science fiction fan.

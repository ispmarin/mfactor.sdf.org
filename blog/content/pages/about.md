Hi there!

I'm a Physicist turned computer scientist turned engineer turned data scientist 
(turned to something amorphous and purple, probably). 
Working with science, Python and data, I'm trying to understand this thing 
called reality that everyone keeps talking about. 

I currently work as a Data Scientist, devising ways to apply
 machine learning and data analysis on huge datasets. 
I'm a physicist with masters in Solid State Physics and a 
PhD on Hydraulic Engineering, being also a photography enthusiast and a science fiction fan.

:summary: What are the possible career paths and skills for data scientists

There are four types of data scientists, according to "Analyzing the Analyzers", por Harlan Harris, Sean Murphy e Mark Vaisman:

- Data developer: technological, scientific method and writes production code
- Data researcher: understanding of complex data
- Data creative: "full stack", related to open source community
- Data businessperson: organization and processes, geared to profit


Skills
------

- Business (Prod Dev, Business)
- ML/Big Data (Unstr Data, Struct Data, ML, Big/Dist Data)
- Math (Optimization, Math, Graph model, Bayesian/MC, Algorithms, Simul.)
- Programming (SysAdmin, BackEnd, FrontEnd)
- Statistics (Visu, Time Stats, Survey, Spatial, Science, Data Manipul, Classical Stats)


Careers in T
------------

- Knowledge in different skills but depth in one of them
- Data developers: careers in Pi
- data researchers have the smallest Ts but the deepest ones
- data creatives are more shallow, with the largest Tss


Superposition of skills makes a data team more effective
--------------------------------------------------------


Data scientists need access to both raw data and decision-makers, and based on our analysis, they need a diversity of skills to make best use of that access.

- Algorithms (ex: computational complexity, CS theory)
- Back-End Programming (ex: JAVA/Rails/Objective C)
- Bayesian/Monte-Carlo Statistics (ex: MCMC, BUGS)
- Big and Distributed Data (ex: Hadoop, Map/Reduce)
- Business (ex: management, business development, budgeting)
- Classical Statistics (ex: general linear model, ANOVA)
- Data Manipulation (ex: regexes, R, SAS, web scraping)
- Front-End Programming (ex: JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- Graphical Models (ex: social networks, Bayes networks)
- Machine Learning (ex: decision trees, neural nets, SVM, clustering)
- Math (ex: linear algebra, real analysis, calculus)
- Optimization (ex: linear, integer, convex, global)
- Product Development (ex: design, project management)
- Science (ex: experimental design, technical writing/publishing)
- Simulation (ex: discrete, agent-based, continuous)
- Spatial Statistics (ex: geographic covariates, GIS)
- Structured Data (ex: SQL, JSON, XML)
- Surveys and Marketing (ex: multinomial modeling)
- Systems Administration (ex: \*nix, DBA, cloud tech.)
- Temporal Statistics (ex: forecasting, time-series analysis)
- Unstructured Data (ex: noSQL, text mining)
- Visualization (ex: statistical graphics, mapping, web-based dataviz)

I´ve been overwhelmed by the number of good publications, workbooks and
other material on Python and Data Science on the web. I tried to keep
track and read everything, but my time on the job has been limited for
that. I decided to keep a list of the sources that I´m reading or want
to read here. They are, in no order:

-  http://www.fullstackpython.com/ Awesome resource for Python web
   development.
-  https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/survival-analysis-r-vs-python/
   Survival analysis in R and Python. Excellent resource to combine
   ipython notebooks with R. (The entire plotly notebooks collection is
   awesome. I would love if plotly was open source or at least free.)
-  https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks This is
   an awesome collection of notebooks with all the parts of a good data
   stack on Python. Still no time to review them all, but so far, very
   good and detailed. `This is
   one <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/scipy/effect_size.ipynb>`__
   of the best on the statistical side.
-  http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/ This one is very through, even
   if sometimes a bit rough on the edges. Very good reference material.
   There are other materials from the folks at Duke that are very good,
   like `this <http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/pcfb/>`__ one, a bit more
   biological.
-  https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning More on the
   line of Machine Learning, this collection is also quite good, if a
   bit extensive. The objective is more to list all resources and
   libraries on several languages about Machine Learning than just
   Python, but nonetheless the Python section is good.
-  Keeping the more generalist vibe,\ `this
   list <http://www.wzchen.com/data-science-books>`__\ of free books
   about Data Science has the basic stuff for the job.

I will keep things updated here as the list grows. Please send me
suggestions of good resources that you want to see on this list!
